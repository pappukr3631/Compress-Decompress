Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future.

Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future
Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future
Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.

Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future
Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future
Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to

It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future
Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future
Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future
Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for

in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them

able to open up, lack of focus, not able to say no to people, etc.
• Always add how you are working on overcoming the weakness now
• Idea is to show that you are mature, know your weakness and are
working on it

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

• Always add how you are working on overcoming the weakness now
• Idea is to show that you are mature, know your weakness and are
working on it

candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be

your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the

childcare.

your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas

to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future
Interview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

Q4. What are your weaknesses?
Tips
• You DON’T need to make your weakness look like your strength
• Think of a genuine weakness about yourself, eg: procrastination, shy/ not
able to open up, lack of focus, not able to say no to people, etc.
• Always add how you are working on overcoming the weakness now
• Idea is to show that you are mature, know your weakness and are
working on it

Q5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Tips
• Keep your answer generic; no one knows where they will be after 5 years
• Some things everyone would want: learning and gaining expertise in
your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

Q4. What are your weaknesses?
Tips
• You DON’T need to make your weakness look like your strength
• Think of a genuine weakness about yourself, eg: procrastination, shy/ not
able to open up, lack of focus, not able to say no to people, etc.
• Always add how you are working on overcoming the weakness now
• Idea is to show that you are mature, know your weakness and are
working on it

Q5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Tips
• Keep your answer generic; no one knows where they will be after 5 years
• Some things everyone would want: learning and gaining expertise in
your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

the company; around Work, Growth opportunities, Team and culture
• Don’t ask irrelevant stuff eg: asking a big company, how the company’s
growth projections look like
• Given a chance, as a second question, you can ask for feedback on the
interview if not already given

you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

Q4. What are your weaknesses?
Tips
• You DON’T need to make your weakness look like your strength
• Think of a genuine weakness about yourself, eg: procrastination, shy/ not
able to open up, lack of focus, not able to say no to people, etc.
• Always add how you are working on overcoming the weakness now
• Idea is to show that you are mature, know your weakness and are
working on it

Q5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Tips
• Keep your answer generic; no one knows where they will be after 5 years
• Some things everyone would want: learning and gaining expertise in
your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

the company; around Work, Growth opportunities, Team and culture
• Don’t ask irrelevant stuff eg: asking a big company, how the company’s
growth projections look like
• Given a chance, as a second question, you can ask for feedback on the
interview if not already given

Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because

have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

Q4. What are your weaknesses?
Tips
• You DON’T need to make your weakness look like your strength
• Think of a genuine weakness about yourself, eg: procrastination, shy/ not
able to open up, lack of focus, not able to say no to people, etc.

• Some things everyone would want: learning and gaining expertise in
your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

the company; around Work, Growth opportunities, Team and culture
• Don’t ask irrelevant stuff eg: asking a big company, how the company’s
growth projections look like
• Given a chance, as a second question, you can ask for feedback on the
interview if not already given

If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s

you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people

It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two

There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s

It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people

It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two

generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.

unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two

because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.

unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been

which you are appearing before the interviewer. You should mention the
relevant work experience.
Q11. What made you apply for the position?

interviewer for their time.
After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two

you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews

unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been

Ans. You can talk about activities that you like pursuing. Here is an approach to
answer this question.
“In my spare time, I like to work on upgrading my skills and knowledge. For
skills, I have enrolled in courses to upscale myself. I also like travelling, playing
sports and spending time with my family and friends.”
Q9. Why do you want to work for our organisation/ Why do you
want to join us?
Ans. xxxxxx is one of the most successful companies in the world. As per the
reviews, the work culture is employee-friendly that offers a suitable
environment for professional growth.
Q10. What are your current skills and experience?/ Tell me about
your work experience.
Ans. You should talk about those skills that are relevant to the job profile for
which you are appearing before the interviewer. You should mention the
relevant work experience.
Q11. What made you apply for the position?
Ans. This position offers newer opportunities to put my skills to use. I would
also get a chance to learn more through experience and mentors who bring a
fresh perspective. This role is similar to my previous profile but it does come
with more opportunities.
Q12. What are your expectations in the corporate world?
Ans. My expectations include a healthy work culture where I can maintain a
balance between my professional and personal life. I look forward to working
with mentors who will help in upgrading my skills. I would also like
opportunities where I can feel a healthy challenge to explore my skills.
Q13. Why did you opt in this field?
Ans. This is a crucial question since interviewers will definitely like to
understand the reason behind changing your domain. Your answer must be
logical and reasonable. You can talk about the growth prospect and how this
field will help in improving your skills.
14. How to end an interview?
Ans. At the end of an interview, you should ask any questions that you may have
regarding the profile. Once you have clarified your doubts, thank the
interviewer for their time.
After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two

are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two

that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be

gestures.

which you are appearing before the interviewer. You should mention the
relevant work experience.
Q11. What made you apply for the position?
Ans. This position offers newer opportunities to put my skills to use. I would
also get a chance to learn more through experience and mentors who bring a
fresh perspective. This role is similar to my previous profile but it does come
with more opportunities.
Q12. What are your expectations in the corporate world?
Ans. My expectations include a healthy work culture where I can maintain a

logical and reasonable. You can talk about the growth prospect and how this
field will help in improving your skills.
14. How to end an interview?
Ans. At the end of an interview, you should ask any questions that you may have
regarding the profile. Once you have clarified your doubts, thank the
interviewer for their time.
After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then

Q12. What are your expectations in the corporate world?
Ans. My expectations include a healthy work culture where I can maintain a
balance between my professional and personal life. I look forward to working
with mentors who will help in upgrading my skills. I would also like
opportunities where I can feel a healthy challenge to explore my skills.
Q13. Why did you opt in this field?
Ans. This is a crucial question since interviewers will definitely like to
understand the reason behind changing your domain. Your answer must be
logical and reasonable. You can talk about the growth prospect and how this
field will help in improving your skills.
14. How to end an interview?
Ans. At the end of an interview, you should ask any questions that you may have
regarding the profile. Once you have clarified your doubts, thank the
interviewer for their time.
After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

Q13. Why did you opt in this field?
Ans. This is a crucial question since interviewers will definitely like to
understand the reason behind changing your domain. Your answer must be
logical and reasonable. You can talk about the growth prospect and how this
field will help in improving your skills.
14. How to end an interview?
Ans. At the end of an interview, you should ask any questions that you may have
regarding the profile. Once you have clarified your doubts, thank the
interviewer for their time.
After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two

may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

Ans. At the end of an interview, you should ask any questions that you may have
regarding the profile. Once you have clarified your doubts, thank the
interviewer for their time.
After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

Q5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Tips
• Keep your answer generic; no one knows where they will be after 5 years
• Some things everyone would want: learning and gaining expertise in
your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

the company; around Work, Growth opportunities, Team and culture
• Don’t ask irrelevant stuff eg: asking a big company, how the company’s
growth projections look like

gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

your tech stack, confident personality, managerial position/ leadership,
financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two
• Don’t get too specific. Eg: I want to become Director of engineering in 5
years

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech

My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

financial stability, decision making position/ freedom to implement your
ideas
• Show that you are looking at a long term career. Eg: Don’t say you would
startup in a year or two

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.

javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech

hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills

me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!
If you’re going to impress at interview, you need to prepare thoroughly. This
handbook sets out what to do to prepare, some pointers about how to behave
and react in the interview and what you might expect at an interview.
The most important thing to remember about any interview is that it is a
two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.
Some Quick QnA templates:
Q1. Tell me something about yourself
Tips:
• Brief them about your story- place, college
• If you’re from a non tech background, why you want to get into tech
• Talk about your experiences in college/ otherwise -these can be projects,
hackathons, events, skills you learnt
• Talk more about coding relevant learnings; what languages did you learn,
which projects you’ve made using which technologies
• Share about your interests and experiences
• Try to keep it light and don’t overwhelm the interviewer
• Use this question to drive the whole interview

Example:
My name is <name> and I am currently pursuing <engineering/degree> in
<department> from <college> <city>. Previously I have interned as a web
developer with <company name>. I have keen interest in designing and
building web applications. I have proficiency in front end technologies like
javascript, react, css, html and have built multiple projects to polish my skills as
well. Currently, I am working on building a MCQ test taking application. When
not learning coding I love playing chess. I have played chess at district level.
Other than that I have also organized various events in my college which gave
me the opportunity to work on my leadership and team building skills. I
strongly believe that work ethics and curiosity to learn will help me grow
further. I love interacting with new people, sharing ideas and opinions on
politics, technology and markets :)

two-way process. It is as much about you finding out whether you want
to work for the company as them finding out whether they want you.
This means it is important to present yourself as you really are, not
pretend to be something you’re not.
Preparing For The Interview
Your preparation before the day of the interview needs to be on two main
fronts:
Research the Organisation
Find out as much as you can about the company.
Look at their website, and any information that they have sent you, and see if
you can find their mission, objectives, any value statements and the like. It’s
helpful to be familiar with the organisation’s guiding principles. Also try to
find out how the job that you have applied for fits into the organisation.
Make a list of the questions about the organisation, ideally around work,
such as the team you will be working with, or the work that you will be doing
on a daily basis. It’s OK to ask about the on-site gym and the holiday
allowance, but don’t sound as if you’re only interested in getting away from
work!
It’s probably not a great idea to ask whether you’ll be able to work part-time
at this stage. Either you should already have done that before applying, or you
need to be prepared to work the hours stated.
About you
You need to sit down with the person specification and your application, and
develop some new examples of how you meet at least a few of the
requirements. It is fine to talk about the examples on your application form or
CV/covering letter, but it’s useful to have a few new ones too. Describe the
situation in one sentence or less, and focus on your actions, the results that
you achieved, and how you knew you were successful.
It’s also helpful to prepare answers for some of the standard icebreakers, such
as ‘Tell me a bit about your current job’, or ‘Tell me why you’ve applied for
this job’. Your answers should focus on your skills, and how you can use them
in the new job, again based around the person specification. Don’t learn them
off by heart, but have a good idea of what you want to say.
Attending the Interview
Some General Dos and Don’ts
Do:
• Arrive in good time. The interview panel may be interviewing a lot of
candidates so do not keep them waiting.
• Dress appropriately. Some organisations, especially technology
companies, have a very casual dress code but, for most, a suit will be
appropriate interview wear. Remember that you are being judged on
the appearance that you present.
• Act appropriately, which usually means following the interviewer’s
lead. If you are offered a hand to shake, then shake it, but don’t offer
your own hand if nobody else seems interested.
• Engage with the interviewers. Smile, make eye contact, and build
rapport
• Answer the questions that are asked, using relevant examples where at
all possible.
Don’t:
• Be afraid to blow your own trumpet a bit. After all, nobody else is going
to blow it for you; however do not lie or exaggerate. If you want the job,
be enthusiastic and positive.
• Be over-familiar or share too much information. For example, the
interviewers don’t want to know how you’re going to manage your
childcare.
What to Expect in the Interview
How Many Interviewers?
The letter inviting you to interview will probably state who will be
interviewing you. It’s often three to five people, because that removes
any individual bias, so don’t be surprised to walk in and find a roomful
of people. One will probably take the lead, and explain who will be
asking questions as well as the role of the others.
When you’re asked a question, reply to the person who asked the question.
The others may intervene, either during or after your answer, in which case
you’ll also need to reply to the intervention. Again, reply to that person and
not to the group generally.
Types of Questions
Interviewers often like to start with an easy ‘ice breaker’ question, such
as “Tell us why you applied for this job?” If you’ve done your preparation,
you’ll be ready for this.
Modern interviews tend to be ‘competence-based’, which means that they
focus on your skills, and how you can demonstrate them.
So questions will often be in the form of:
• Tell us about the time when you…
• Can you give us an example of a time when you…
• From your previous experience, how would you deal with a situation like
…
If you don’t have much work experience, don’t worry. Be prepared to say
“Well, I haven’t actually had to do that yet, but this is what I would do in the
situation”. If you’re being interviewed for a job where you don’t have much
experience in the field, the interviewers will usually try to help by giving you
hypothetical questions and asking you how you would approach a problem.
They know you don’t have much experience, but they’re trying to give you a
chance to show that you can do the job.
The interviewers are not trying to trip you up as a general rule so, if you get a
question that you don’t understand, just say so and ask them to expand a bit.
There are still interviewers around who believe in the benefits of asking ‘off
the wall’ questions like ‘If you were a car, what type would you be?’ and ‘What
are your best and worst traits?’ Just humour them! Have a fairly bland and
generic reply prepared such as ‘Well, I’m not sure what type of
animal/car/bird/whatever I’d be, but I do know that I set myself high
standards and am not happy unless I’m working hard!”
At The End
At the end of the interview, you will probably be asked if you have any
questions.
It is usually a good idea to ask a few questions about the organisation or role
at this point. However, if you really don’t have any questions, perhaps because
you spoke to someone from the organisation before the interview and they
have answered all your questions, then it’s fine to say so. Do explain that it’s
because you spoke to [name] and they were able to answer all your questions
ahead of time.
It’s also acceptable to ask when the organisation will expect to let people
know the outcome of their application.
It may also be worth asking if there is anything that they feel that you didn’t
address as well as you could have done, or that wasn’t entirely clear. It gives
you a second chance if you were a bit nervous and didn’t answer as well as
you could have done early on.
Remote Interviews
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses have faced
unprecedented demand for their products or services. Some have been
actively recruiting, and have had to find new ways to manage the process that
are considered safe for interviewers and interviewees alike. Many have
turned to remote interviews via video-conferencing apps like Skype or Zoom.
The ‘rules’ for remote interviews are generally very similar to face-to-face
interviews. For example, you should dress appropriately—and that really
means from head to toe. You may think that you can get away with wearing
pyjama bottoms, but that will probably make you feel less professional—and
that will come across. It is also more or less guaranteed that you will forget,
and go to shut the door to keep the cat out. You should also ‘arrive’ on time,
which in practice means being ready, checking your technology ahead of time,
and connecting to the call a few minutes early. Obviously, you should also
engage with the interviewers.
Finally, don’t forget to remove distractions. If you are using a laptop, turn off
your phone, and if you are using your phone for the interview, turn off
notifications.
However, there are also some important differences.
First, be alone. The internet is currently full of horror stories about people
whose parents or friends were sitting next to them in remote interviews
feeding them answers. It is obvious, even if you are very slick at muting and
unmuting yourself. You will be better able to manage—and present yourself
as you—if you are on your own, and answering for yourself.
Second, choose your space and your background wisely. Your bedroom
may be your only private space—but think about what you may be showing
your interviewers. A neutral space is better if possible. An artificial
background may be fun, but does it really convey the right impression?
Third, think about your use of non-verbal communication. You will not be
able to use body language as much, but your facial expressions will be much
clearer. You therefore need to avoid relying on body language and expansive
gestures.
Warning!
Unless you have considerable experience, it is hard to emphasise your facial
expressions without looking like you are making faces. However, it can be
helpful to be aware of the change in balance in your non-verbal
communication.
And Finally…
Before you leave, thank the interview panel for the chance to attend the
interview and say that it was nice to meet them. Smile, gain eye contact
and shake hands if appropriate. Always leave a good final impression.
You will find out in due course if you were successful. If you were not then
it can be a good idea to ask for feedback. You may gain some useful tips
and advice to improve your chances at your next interview.

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.
Key Points
All of us need to brush up on our interview skills from time to time.
Preparation is essential before an interview. Research the company, prepare
answers for likely questions, plan your journey, and role-play your
performance. If you're struggling with confidence, take the time to invest in
yourself and learn techniques to keep your cool.
During the interview, try to make a good first impression, pay close attention
to your tone and body language, and ask questions. Listen attentively to make
sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the futureInterview Skills
You have received an invitation to interview for a new job: congratulations!

After the Interview
You're not finished when you walk out of the interview room! Follow the
steps below to make sure that you get the best out of the whole process.
1. Follow Up
After your interview, send a thank-you letter or email within 24 hours.
Include everyone on the interview panel, not just the person at the top. If you
can't contact everyone directly, ask your primary contact to pass on your
thanks.
2. If You're Offered the Job
If you're offered the position, congratulations! You now need to gather all the
information you can about your role. This is the time to get details about your
start date, the terms and conditions of employment, and what kind
of onboarding or training you'll receive.
3. If You're Not Offered the Job
A rejection can be tough to process, especially if it was a role you really
wanted or thought you could easily secure.
Keep in mind that sometimes things simply don't go our way. There will be
many factors behind the decision of who gets a job offer. If it wasn't you this
time, try not to take it personally.
4. Get Feedback
Once the process is complete, try to get feedback from your interviewers on
how you performed, and how well your skills matched the position on offer.
If you didn't get the job or contract, learn whatever lessons you can to
increase your chances of success in the future. And if you were successful,
you'll know which areas you can improve on when you start your new role.

sure you're answering exactly what you're being asked.
Once the interview is over, send a thank-you message to everyone involved in
the process. Whether you secure the position or not, ask for feedback to learn
from the experience, and to improve your interview skills for the future
